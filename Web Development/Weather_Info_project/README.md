**Weather Info project for Web Development at Oregon State University.**

**Languages used:** JavaScript, HTML5
                                           
**Steps to run:**
1) download this directory (weather_info_project)                                                
2) open the index.html file with a browser
                                                  
**Demonstrates:** HTML5 form creation, asynchronous AJAX get and post

**Assignment description:** The HTML page(s) should have two forms. The first is the form you will construct in the activites that connect to Open Weather Map, lets a user input a city or a zip code and asynchronously shows the weather information retrieved from Open Weather Map (via a GET).

The other should be a form that submits to http://httpbin.org/post.

This form should submit asynchronously via a POST. It needs to send a content-type of application/json (you can also experiment with other content-types like application/x-www-form-urlencoded). You should display the data you get back (which should match the data you send). It will be stored as a string in the data field of the JSON encoded string returned from the server.

If you run into trouble, you can use a tool like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

which will let you submit data manually via a GUI to check what the output looks like.
