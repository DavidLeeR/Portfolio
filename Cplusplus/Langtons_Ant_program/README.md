**Langton's Ant program**

**Steps to compile and run program:**                                                   
Requires g++ (GNU) compiler version 4.8.5                                                            
1) Download this directory (Langtons_Ant_program)                                      
2) navigate to Langtons_Ant_program directory with command line                                
3) enter the command **make ant** to compile the program                                 
4) enter the command **./ant** to run the program

**Description:** C++ implementation of "Langton's Ant", a two-dimensional universal turing machine.  For a brief explanation consider Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant.  Note that it can be considered as a cellular automaton.  This means that you have an array or matrix of cells.  Each turn or step, the value of each cell may change based upon a simple rule.
